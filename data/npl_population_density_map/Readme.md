Nepal: High Resolution Population Density Maps + Demographic Estimates

The world's most accurate population datasets. Seven maps/datasets for the distribution of various populations in Nepal: (1) Overall population density (2) Women (3) Men (4) Children (ages 0-5) (5) Youth (ages 15-24) (6) Elderly (ages 60+) (7) Women of reproductive age (ages 15-49).

Methodology

To create our high-resolution maps, we use machine learning techniques to identify buildings from commercially available satellite images. Then we work with our partners at Columbia University to overlay general population estimates based on publicly available census data and other population statistics. The resulting maps are the most detailed and actionable tools available for aid and research organizations.
